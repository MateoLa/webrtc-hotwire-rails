In most operating system, two different processes can not have the camera open at the same time. One straightforward option is to buy multiple cameras.

For testing you can use in Firefox media.navigator.streams.fake (in about:config) or you can start your Chrome from console whith: <br>
> chromium --use-fake-device-for-media-stream <br>
In both cases this is going to simulate a video stream that you going to see in the other browser.
